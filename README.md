# Neural Network Architectures

I've been learning about types of neural network architectures for my internship, so this is a small collection of the ones I've learned/currently learning.

## scratch_mlp_skl.py
Simple 3 layer MLP written from scratch with some help from the SciKit-Learn module. Classifier for the MNIST dataset. Through writing this I learned the general structure and math behind neural networks, including feed forward, back propagation, and gradient descent.

## mlp_tf.py
Simple 3 layer MLP written using the TensorFlow module. Classifier for the MNIST dataset.

## cnn_tf.py
Convolutional neural network written using the TensorFlow module. Classifier for the MNIST dataset.
